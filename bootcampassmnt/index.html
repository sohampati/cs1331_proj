<h3>Hey, my name is Soham Pati and I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I am a first year student here at Georgia Tech. I really enjoy playing the violin at nursing homes. I also like to volunteer through social clubs and groups in my school and community. So far, I believe that my biggest achievement has been being able to raise money and volunteer by creating a website for Vibha - a nonprofit focused on raising money for underprivileged children in India.</h3>
